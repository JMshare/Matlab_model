# Custer UAV Flight Dynamics mathematical model 
as per the thesis, implemented in MATLAB

call Load_params(1) to load all the Custer UAV parameters and generate plots.

run Run_to_Trim.m to generate the trim points along the Custer UAV flight envelope.

run Run_A_eigs.m to see the state matrices and generate the eigenvalue plots.
